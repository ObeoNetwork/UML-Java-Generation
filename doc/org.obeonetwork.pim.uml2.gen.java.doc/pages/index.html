            <h2>Open Source</h2>
            <p>
              The UML to Java generator is an open source code generator developed by Obeo. As such, you can
              use it freely, fork it and even contribute back. It is based on the popular open source code generator Acceleo.
              The source code is freely available on Github.
            </p>

            <h2>Integrated in Eclipse</h2>
            <p>
              The UML to Java generator is deeply integrated in the Eclipse IDE with a launch configuration where you can
              tune up the generation for your specific needs. It also contains a dedicated builder to set up an automatic code generation.
            </p>

            <h2>Standard</h2>
            <p>
              Based on Acceleo (an implementation of the OMG's MOFM2T standard for code generation), OCL (the OMG's standard for
              model navigation) and the Eclipse UML2 project (an implementation of the UML 2.x meta-model from the OMG), this code
              generator is using all the standard available for ULM to Java code generation.

            <h2>Class Diagram</h2>
            <p>
              The UML to Java generator takes into account all the content of the Class diagram created with any UML2-compatible tool.
              It enables you to generate classes, interfaces, enumerations and much more. You can start very quickly by creating your
              UML model in an open source tool like UML Designer and generate your code in no time.

            <h2>Component Diagram</h2>
            <p>
              Starting with the 2.0 version of the UML to Java generator, the content of Component diagram is also taking into account
              during the generation. By defining components in your input model, you can tell the generator all the projects that you
              want to see generated. The component generation also support the creation of OSGi artifacts.
            </p>

            <h2>Incremental Generation</h2>
            <p>
              Whether you are considering it or not, you will one day have to modify manually your generated code
              and you want to keep your modification even if you are regenerating your code. The UML to Java generator
              defines protected areas where you can safely add you own code.
